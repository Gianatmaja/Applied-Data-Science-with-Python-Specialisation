# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python-Specialisation

### Description:  
This repository contains the coding assignments that I completed throughout the Applied Data Science with Python specialisation in Coursera.
  
### About the specialisation:  
The specialisation includes topics from applied statistical analysis, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx.

The 5 courses are:
